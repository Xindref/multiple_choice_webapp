Here the just distribution of resources, in this case pain management, cannot be justly apportioned Nonmaleficence refers to avoidance of harm; beneficence refers to taking positive actions to help others. Fidelity refers to the agreement to keep promises.

            "answer": "Advocacy",
            "explanation": "Nurses advocate for patients when they support the patient's cause. A nurse's ability to adequately advocate for a patient is based on the unique relationship that develops and the opportunity to better understand the patient's point of view. Responsibility refers to respecting one's professional obligations and following through on promises.

The nurse understands that sharing health information is governed by HIPAA legislation, which defines rights and privileges of patients for protection of privacy. Private health information cannot be shared without the patient's specific permission. The nurse cannot obtain the records without permission. The son can look at it after approval from the patient.

            "answer": "So different perspectives are respected.",
            "explanation": "Values are personal beliefs that influence behavior. To negotiate differences of value, it is important to be clear about your own values: what you value, why, and how you respect your own values even as you try to respect those of others whose values differ from yours. Ethical dilemmas are a problem in that no one right solution exists. It is not to separate fact from opinion. Judgmental attitudes are not to be used, much less provoked.",

While unequal power, judgmental perceptions, and poor communication can contribute to the dilemma, these are not causes of a dilemma.

            "answer": "Autonomy",
            "explanation": "The nurse is upholding autonomy. Autonomy refers to the freedom to make decisions free of external control. Respect for patient autonomy refers to the commitment to include patients in decisions about all aspects of care. Consequentialism is focused on the outcome and is a philosophical approach.

            "answer": "Review one's own personal values.",
            "explanation": "Clarifying values—your own, your patients', your co-workers'—is an important and effective part of ethical discourse. Calling for a consult, declining the assignment, and convincing the family to challenge the patient's directive are not ideal resolutions because they do not address the reason for the nurse's discomfort, which is the conflict between the nurse's values and those of the patient.

A person who values autonomy highly may find it difficult to accept situations where the patient is not the primary decision maker regarding his or her care.

This system of ethics focuses on the outcome of the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

Even if you post an image of a patient without any obvious identifiers, the nature of shared media reposting can result in the image surfacing in a place where just the context of the image provides clues for friends or family to identify the patient. The ANA and NCSBN states, “Effective nurse-patient relationships are built on trust.

A vaccine is administered to prevent or lessen the likelihood of contracting an infectious disease at some time in the future. The term futile refers to something that is hopeless or serves no useful purpose. In health care discussions, the term refers to interventions unlikely to produce benefit for a patient.

Some patients at risk for aspiration may require thickened liquids; thinning liquids does not decrease aspiration risk.

For example, when using an overhead trapeze, the patient slowly lowers himself to the bed. The lowering is controlled when the antagonistic muscles lengthen. By pushing on the chair arms and rising eccentric tension and isotonic contraction occurred. In concentric tension, increased muscle contraction causes muscle shortening, resulting in movement such as when a patient uses an overhead trapeze to pull up in bed. Concentric and eccentric muscle actions are necessary for active movement and therefore are referred to as dynamic or isotonic contraction. Isometric contraction (static contraction) causes an increase in muscle tension or muscle work but no shortening or active movement of the muscle (e.g., instructing the patient to tighten and relax a muscle group, as in quadriceps set exercises or pelvic floor exercises).",

Mobilize the patient as soon as the physical condition allows, even if this only involves dangling at the bedside or moving to a chair. A wide base of support increases balance. Isometric exercises (i.e., activities that involve muscle tension without muscle shortening) have no beneficial effect on preventing orthostatic hypotension, but they improve activity tolerance.

Immobilized patients are at risk for calculi because they frequently have hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia does not lead to hypostatic pneumonia, pressure ulcers, or thrombus formation. Immobility is one cause of hypostatic pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung from stasis or pooling of secretions. A pressure ulcer is an impairment of the skin that results from prolonged ischemia (decreased blood supply) within tissues. A thrombus is an accumulation of platelets, fibrin, clotting factors, and cellular elements of the blood attached to the interior wall of a vein or artery, which sometimes occludes the lumen of the vessel.",

Sometimes nurses inadvertently contribute to a patient's immobility by providing unnecessary help with activities such as bathing and transferring. Placing the patient on bed rest without sufficient ambulation leads to loss of mobility and functional decline, resulting in weakness, fatigue, and increased risk for falls.

When the intensity of the pressure exerted on the capillary exceeds 15 to 32 mm Hg, this occludes the vessel, causing ischemic injury to the tissues it normally feeds.

Moisture can originate from wound drainage, excessive perspiration, and fecal or urinary incontinence. Bacteria and enzymes in the stool can enhance the opportunity for skin breakdown because the skin is moistened and softened, causing maceration. Eating a balanced diet is important for nutrition, but eating just two thirds of the meal does not indicate that the individual is at risk. A raised red rash on the leg again is a concern and can affect the integrity of the skin, but it is located on the shin, which is not a high-risk area for skin breakdown.

Partial-thickness repairs are done on partial-thickness wounds that are shallow, involving loss of the epidermis and maybe partial loss of the dermis.

            "explanation": "A hematoma is a localized collection of blood underneath the tissues. It appears as swelling, change in color, sensation, or warmth or a mass that often takes on a bluish discoloration. A hematoma near a major artery or vein is dangerous because it can put pressure on the vein or artery and obstruct blood flow. Itching is not a complication. Incisions should be approximated with edges together; this is a sign of normal healing. After surgery, when nerves in the skin and tissues have been traumatized by the surgical procedure, it is expected that the patient will experience pain.",

Dehiscence occurs when an incision fails to heal properly, and the layers of skin and tissue separate. It involves abdominal surgical wounds and occurs after a sudden strain such as coughing, vomiting, or sitting up in bed. Evisceration is seen when vital organs protrude through a wound opening.

The nurse also is responsible for covering exposed wounds or open abrasions with a dressing and assessing the condition of underlying dressings and changing if soiled, as well as assessing the skin of underlying areas that will be distal to the bandage. This checks for signs of circulatory impairment, so that a comparison can be made after bandages are applied. Marking the sites of all abrasions is not necessary. Although it is important for the skin to be clean, and even though it may need to be cleaned with a noncytotoxic cleanser, cleansing with hydrogen peroxide can interfere with wound healing.",
