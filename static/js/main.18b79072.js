Here the just distribution of resources, in this case pain management, cannot be justly apportioned Nonmaleficence refers to avoidance of harm; beneficence refers to taking positive actions to help others.

A nurse\'s ability to adequately advocate for a patient is based on the unique relationship that develops and the opportunity to better understand the patient\'s point of view.

The nurse understands that sharing health information is governed by HIPAA legislation, which defines rights and privileges of patients for protection of privacy.

To negotiate differences of value, it is important to be clear about your own values: what you value, why, and how you respect your own values even as you try to respect those of others whose values differ from yours.

Autonomy refers to the freedom to make decisions free of external control. Respect for patient autonomy refers to the commitment to include patients in decisions about all aspects of care.

Calling for a consult, declining the assignment, and convincing the family to challenge the patient\'s directive are not ideal resolutions because they do not address the reason for the nurse\'s discomfort, which is the conflict between the nurse\'s values and those of the patient.

A person who values autonomy highly may find it difficult to accept situations where the patient is not the primary decision maker regarding his or her care.

This system of ethics focuses on the outcome of the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

Which ethical principle is at greatest risk?","options":["Fidelity","Autonomy","Beneficence","Nonmaleficence"],"answer":"Nonmaleficence","explanation":"Nonmaleficence is the ethical principle that focuses on avoidance of harm or hurt. Repeated PUBS may expose the mother and fetus to some risks. Fidelity refers to the agreement to keep promises (obtain serial PUBS).

A vaccine is administered to prevent or lessen the likelihood of contracting an infectious disease at some time in the future. The term futile refers to something that is hopeless or serves no useful purpose. In health care discussions, the term refers to interventions unlikely to produce benefit for a patient.

Deontology defines actions as right or wrong based on their \u201cright-making characteristics\u201d such as fidelity to promises, truthfulness, and justice.

Although a quiet room is appropriate, a darkened room interferes with the patient\'s ability to watch your actions,especially when demonstrating a skill or using visual aids such as posters or pamphlets.

Motivation is a force that acts on or within a person (e.g., an idea,emotion, or a physical need) to cause the person to behave in a particular way. For example, a patient with a below-the-knee amputation is motivated to learn how to walk with assistive devices, indicating a readiness to learn. Do not confuse readiness to learn with ability to learn. All the other answers are examples of ability to learn because this often depends on the patient\'s level of physical development and overall physical health. To learn psychomotor skills, a patient needs to possess a certain level of strength, coordination, and sensory acuity. For example, it is useless to teach a patient to transfer from a bed to a wheelchair if he or she has insufficient upper body strength.

A positive variance occurs when a patient progresses more rapidly than expected (e.g.,use of a Foley catheter may be discontinued a day early). When a nurse is using the problem-oriented medical record, after analyzing data, health care team members identify problems and make a single problem list. A third format used for notes within a POMR is focus charting. It involves the use of DAR notes, which include D\u2014Data (both subjective and objective), A\u2014Action or nursing intervention, and R\u2014Response of the patient (i.e., evaluation of effectiveness).","dif":"Apply (application)","obj":"Discuss the relationship between documentation and financial reimbursement for health care.","top":"Communication and Documentation","msc":"Management of Care"},{"question":"A nurse needs to begin discharge planning for a patient admitted with pneumonia and a congested cough.

Some patients at risk for aspiration may require thickened liquids; thinning liquids does not decrease aspiration risk.

Eccentric tension helps control the speed and direction of movement. For example, when using an overhead trapeze, the patient slowly lowers himself to the bed. The lowering is controlled when the antagonistic muscles lengthen. By pushing on the chair arms and rising eccentric tension and isotonic contraction occurred. In concentric tension, increased muscle contraction causes muscle shortening, resulting in movement such as when a patient uses an overhead trapeze to pull up in bed. Concentric and eccentric muscle actions are necessary for active movement and therefore are referred to as dynamic or isotonic contraction.

Immobilized patients are at risk for calculi because they frequently have hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia does not lead to hypostatic pneumonia, pressure ulcers, or thrombus formation. Immobility is one cause of hypostatic pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung from stasis or pooling of secretions. A pressure ulcer is an impairment of the skin that results from prolonged ischemia (decreased blood supply) within tissues.

In older adults, the heart rate often does not tolerate the added workload, and a form of cardiac failure may develop.

Sometimes nurses inadvertently contribute to a patient\'s immobility by providing unnecessary help with activities such as bathing and transferring. Placing the patient on bed rest without sufficient ambulation leads to loss of mobility and functional decline, resulting in weakness, fatigue, and increased risk for falls.

Three pressure-related factors contribute to pressure ulcer development: pressure intensity, pressure duration, and tissue tolerance. When the intensity of the pressure exerted on the capillary exceeds 15 to 32 mm Hg, this occludes the vessel, causing ischemic injury to the tissues it normally feeds.

Moisture can originate from wound drainage, excessive perspiration, and fecal or urinary incontinence. Bacteria and enzymes in the stool can enhance the opportunity for skin breakdown because the skin is moistened and softened, causing maceration. Eating a balanced diet is important for nutrition, but eating just two thirds of the meal does not indicate that the individual is at risk.

A low-air-loss bed is utilized for prevention or treatment of skin breakdown by preventing buildup of moisture and skin breakdown through the use of airflow.
