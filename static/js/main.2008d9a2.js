The id (i.e., basic instinctual impulses driven to achieve pleasure) is the most primitive part of the personality and originates in the infant. The infant, in this case the patient, cannot tolerate delay and must have needs met immediately. The ego represents the reality component, mediating conflicts between the environment and the forces of the id. The ego helps people judge reality accurately, regulate impulses, and make good decisions. The third component, the superego, performs regulating, restraining, and prohibiting actions. Often referred to as the conscience, the superego is influenced by the standards of outside social forces (e.g., parent or teacher). The child fantasizes about the parent of the opposite sex as his or her first love interest, known as the Oedipus or Electra complex.

In the formal operations period, as adolescents mature, their thinking moves to abstract and theoretical subjects. They have the capacity to reason with respect to possibilities. Hitting would be a common schema during the sensorimotor stage of development. Using play to learn about the environment is indicative of the preoperational stage.

A 4-year-old child would be in the preoperational period of cognitive development. Children at this stage are still egocentric. Play is very important to foster cognitive development. The IV pump and bat are not safe pieces of equipment for a 4-year-old child to play with. A 4-year-old child is of preschool age and more than likely is not able to read yet.

Erikson\u2019s theory proposes that the older adult faces integrity versus despair. Offering a reward does not address the need for continued independence. Encouraging eating in the dining room would be a step after fixing the room since it does not address independence, and the question is asking for the first action. Advising the patient to attend all mandatory activities as the first intervention does not allow for the patient\u2019s independence.

Motivation is a force that acts on or within a person (e.g., an idea,emotion, or a physical need) to cause the person to behave in a particular way. For example, a patient with a below-the-knee amputation is motivated to learn how to walk with assistive devices, indicating a readiness to learn. Do not confuse readiness to learn with ability to learn. All the other answers are examples of ability to learn because this often depends on the patient\'s level of physical development and overall physical health. To learn psychomotor skills, a patient needs to possess a certain level of strength, coordination, and sensory acuity. For example, it is useless to teach a patient to transfer from a bed to a wheelchair if he or she has insufficient upper body strength.

Disturbed body image, indicating dissatisfaction or discomfort with one\'s physical appearance, is evident when a patient expresses, \\"I am ugly with all these burn scars.\\" This statement highlights a negative perception of one\'s body, possibly stemming from physical trauma or disfigurement. Assessing role performance involves evaluating how individuals perceive their effectiveness in fulfilling social roles. When a patient states, \\"I am a good mother,\\" it indicates a positive self-assessment of their role as a parent, suggesting healthy role performance. Lastly, low self-esteem, characterized by feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy, is illustrated by a patient\'s declaration, \\"I am good for nothing.\\" This reflects a negative self-evaluation and diminished sense of self-worth.

Immobilized patients are at risk for calculi because they frequently have hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia does not lead to hypostatic pneumonia, pressure ulcers, or thrombus formation. Immobility is one cause of hypostatic pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung from stasis or pooling of secretions. A pressure ulcer is an impairment of the skin that results from prolonged ischemia (decreased blood supply) within tissues.

A constant or intermittent bubbling in the water-seal chamber indicates a leak in the drainage system, and the health care provider must be notified immediately. Stripping the tube is not routinely performed as it increases pressure. If the tubing disconnects from the drainage unit, instruct the patient to exhale as much as possible and to cough. This maneuver rids the pleural space of as much air as possible. Temporarily reestablish a water seal by immersing the open end of the chest tube into a container of sterile water.

While exhaling, the patient opens the glottis by saying the word huff. The quad cough technique is for patients without abdominal muscle control such as those with spinal cord injuries. While the patient breathes out with a maximal expiratory effort, the patient or nurse pushes inward and upward on the abdominal muscles toward the diaphragm, causing the cough. With the cascade cough the patient takes a slow, deep breath and holds it for 2 seconds while contracting expiratory muscles. Then he or she opens the mouth and performs a series of coughs throughout exhalation, thereby coughing at progressively lowered lung volumes. This technique promotes airway clearance and a patent airway in patients with large volumes of sputum. Incentive spirometry encourages voluntary deep breathing by providing visual feedback to patients about inspiratory volume.

AC, PSV, and SIMV are invasive mechanical ventilation and are not routinely used on patients with sleep apnea. AC delivers a set tidal volume (VT) with each breath, regardless of whether the breath was triggered by the patient or the ventilator. Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation like AC delivers a minimum number of fully assisted breaths per minute that are synchronized with the patient\u2019s respiratory effort. Any breaths taken between volume-cycled breaths are not assisted; the volume of these breaths is determined by the patient\u2019s strength, effort, and lung mechanics.

Opioids are safe to use in older adults as long as they are slowly titrated, and the nurse frequently monitors the patient. Patients with dementia most likely experience unrelieved pain because their pain is difficult to assess. Older adults frequently eat poorly, resulting in low serum albumin levels.

Relaxation and guided imagery can be used during any phase of health or illness. TENS units are typically used to manage postsurgical and procedural pain. Herbal supplements need to be evaluated for safety during pregnancy. Additionally, some patients consider herbal supplements to be another form of medication, and they are not typically used to control acute pain.

A limit on the number of doses per hour or 4-hour interval may also be set. This can help decrease a patient\u2019s anxiety related to possible overdose. Its use also often eases anxiety because the patient is not reliant on the nurse for pain relief. Other medications, such as oral analgesics, can be given in addition to the PCA machine.

Tetracycline has decreased drug absorption with milk and antacids and has decreased nutrient absorption of calcium from binding. Nutritional treatment for diverticulitis includes a moderate- or low-residue diet until the infection subsides. Afterward, prescribing a high-fiber diet for chronic diverticula problems ensues. A patient with a gastric residual volume of 500 mL needs to have the feeding withheld and reassessed for tolerance to feedings. All the rest are normal and expected and do not require follow-up.

The second type of continent urinary diversion is called an orthotopic neobladder, which uses an ileal pouch to replace the bladder. Anatomically, the pouch is in the same position as the bladder was before removal, allowing a patient to void through the urethra using a Valsalva technique.

Using a bladder diary, the usual times a patient voids are identified. It is at these times that the patient is then toileted. Prompted voiding is a program of toileting designed for patients with mild or moderately cognitive impairment. Patients are toileted based upon their usual voiding pattern. Caregivers ask the patient if they are wet or dry, give positive feedback for dryness, prompt the patient to toilet, and reward the patient for desired behavior. Timed voiding or scheduled toileting is toileting based upon a fixed schedule, not the patient\u2019s urge to void. The schedule maybe set by a time interval, every 2 to 3 hours or at times of day such as before and after meals. In bladder retraining, patients are taught to inhibit the urge to void by taking slow and deep breaths to relax, perform 5 to 6 quick strong pelvic muscle exercises (flicks) in quick succession followed by distracting attention from bladder sensations. When the urge to void becomes less severe or subsides, only then should the patient start the trip to the bathroom.

The circulating nurse also manages patient positioning, antimicrobial skin preparation, medications, implants, placement and function of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices, specimens, warming devices and surgical counts of instruments, and dressings. The RN first assistant collaborates with the surgeon by handling and cutting tissue, using instruments and medical devices, providing exposure of the surgical area and hemostasis, and suturing.

The perioperative nurse is an advocate for the patient during surgery and protects the patient\u2019s dignity and rights at all times. Signs and symptoms of infection do not have the time to present during the intraoperative phase.

Special mattresses, use of foam padding, and attachments to the operating suite table provide protection for the extremities and bony prominences. Bathing before surgery helps to decrease the number of microbes on the skin.

A drop-in oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is a sign of airway obstruction in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Weak pharyngeal/laryngeal muscle tone from anesthetics; secretions in the pharynx, bronchial tree, or trachea; and laryngeal or subglottic edema also contribute to airway obstruction. In the postanesthetic patient, the tongue is a major cause of airway obstruction. Shallow respirations are indicative of respiratory depression.

Malignant hyperthermia causes hypercarbia, tachycardia, tachypnea, premature ventricular contractions, unstable blood pressure, cyanosis, skin mottling, and muscular rigidity. It often occurs during anesthesia induction. Hypoxia would manifest with decreased oxygen saturation as one of its signs and symptoms. Fluid imbalance would be assessed with intake and output and can manifest with tachycardia and blood pressure fluctuations but does not have muscle rigidity.

Maintaining blood glucose levels at less than 150 mg/dL has resulted in decreased wound infection. Removing unwanted hair by clipping instead of shaving decreases the numbers of nicks and cuts caused by a razor and the potential for the introduction of microbes. The patient is postoperative; administration of an antibiotic 60 minutes before the surgical incision supports the defense against infection preoperatively.
