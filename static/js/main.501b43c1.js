The id (i.e., basic instinctual impulses driven to achieve pleasure) is the most primitive part of the personality and originates in the infant.

The ego represents the reality component, mediating conflicts between the environment and the forces of the id. The ego helps people judge reality accurately, regulate impulses, and make good decisions. The third component, the superego, performs regulating, restraining, and prohibiting actions. Often referred to as the conscience, the superego is influenced by the standards of outside social forces (e.g., parent or teacher).

Encouraging eating in the dining room would be a step after fixing the room since it does not address independence, and the question is asking for the first action. Advising the patient to attend all mandatory activities as the first intervention does not allow for the patient\u2019s independence.

Some patients at risk for aspiration may require thickened liquids; thinning liquids does not decrease aspiration risk.

Eccentric tension helps control the speed and direction of movement. For example, when using an overhead trapeze, the patient slowly lowers himself to the bed. The lowering is controlled when the antagonistic muscles lengthen. By pushing on the chair arms and rising eccentric tension and isotonic contraction occurred. In concentric tension, increased muscle contraction causes muscle shortening, resulting in movement such as when a patient uses an overhead trapeze to pull up in bed. Concentric and eccentric muscle actions are necessary for active movement and therefore are referred to as dynamic or isotonic contraction.

Orthostatic hypotension is a drop of blood pressure greater than 20 mm Hg in systolic pressure or 10 mm Hg in diastolic pressure and symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, tachycardia, pallor, or fainting when the patient changes from the supine to standing position.

Mobilize the patient as soon as the physical condition allows, even if this only involves dangling at the bedside or moving to a chair. A wide base of support increases balance.

Immobilized patients are at risk for calculi because they frequently have hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia does not lead to hypostatic pneumonia, pressure ulcers, or thrombus formation. Immobility is one cause of hypostatic pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung from stasis or pooling of secretions. A pressure ulcer is an impairment of the skin that results from prolonged ischemia (decreased blood supply) within tissues.

In older adults, the heart rate often does not tolerate the added workload, and a form of cardiac failure may develop.

Sometimes nurses inadvertently contribute to a patient\'s immobility by providing unnecessary help with activities such as bathing and transferring. Placing the patient on bed rest without sufficient ambulation leads to loss of mobility and functional decline, resulting in weakness, fatigue, and increased risk for falls.

It is safe for long- and short-term use particularly in older adults. The use of benzodiazepines in older adults is potentially dangerous because of the tendency of the drugs to remain active in the body for a longer time. As a result, they also cause respiratory depression, next-day sedation, amnesia, rebound insomnia, and impaired motor functioning and coordination, which leads to increased risk of falls. Caution older adults about using over-the-counter antihistamines because their long duration of action can cause confusion, constipation, and urinary retention.

Three pressure-related factors contribute to pressure ulcer development: pressure intensity, pressure duration, and tissue tolerance. When the intensity of the pressure exerted on the capillary exceeds 15 to 32 mm Hg, this occludes the vessel, causing ischemic injury to the tissues it normally feeds.

Moisture can originate from wound drainage, excessive perspiration, and fecal or urinary incontinence. Bacteria and enzymes in the stool can enhance the opportunity for skin breakdown because the skin is moistened and softened, causing maceration. Eating a balanced diet is important for nutrition, but eating just two thirds of the meal does not indicate that the individual is at risk.
